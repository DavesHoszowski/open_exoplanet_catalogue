			<description>The Kepler-11 systems contains six transiting planets. The system was originally discovered by the Kepler telescope in 2011. The inner five planets make up a tightly packed system. A dynamical analysis revealed that the inner planets have a remarkably low density, lower than that of rock.</description>

			<imagedescription>Kepler-11 is a Sun-like star around which six planets orbit. At times, two or more planets pass in front of the star at once, as shown in this artist's conception of a simultaneous transit of three planets observed by NASA's Kepler spacecraft on Aug. 26, 2010.
